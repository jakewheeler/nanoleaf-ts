# nanoleaf-ts

nanoleaf-ts is a package that makes interacting with your Nanoleaf Aurora more pleasant ðŸ˜„

It provides a simple abstraction layer over the Aurora's local-network REST API.

## Features

- All available interactions with the Nanoleaf Aurora
- Entirely promise based
- Written in TypeScript
- No dependencies
- Full test suite

## Installation

WIP

## Getting an Auth Token

In order to use nanoleaf-ts, you'll need to acquire an authorization token for your Aurora. Please take a look at [Nanoleaf's documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1559645/RW1gEcCH?version=latest#edd41442-c94f-49dc-977b-8180be92e018) to get started.

## Let's See Some Code

Here's an example in TypeScript showing how to check if your Aurora is on or off:

```typescript
import Nanoleaf from './nanoleaf';
import { config } from 'dotenv';

config();

(async (): Promise<void> => {
  let nanoleaf = new Nanoleaf({
    ipAddress: process.env.IP_ADDRESS!,
    apiVersion: '/api/v1/',
    port: process.env.PORT!,
    authToken: process.env.AUTH_TOKEN!,
  });

  try {
    let isOn = await nanoleaf.state.isTurnedOn();
    console.log(isOn);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
})();
```

Note that this example is loading the IP address, port, and authToken from the environment. This is not required but strongly suggested.

## Documentation

nanoleaf-ts is composed of six main classes:

- `nanoleaf` - exposes everything below
- `state` - brightness, hue, on/off, etc.
- `effects` - set current effect, get list of available effects, etc.
- `layout` - general panel layout information
- `panels` - identification functionality
- `rhythm` - accessing rhythm module properties

### Creating the Nanoleaf Object

To start working with the package, create a nanoleaf object similarly to what is shown below.

Pass in the IP address, API version, port, and auth token as strings.

```typescript
import Nanoleaf from './nanoleaf';

let nanoleaf = new Nanoleaf({
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.200', // you can check your router page to find your Aurora's IP
  apiVersion: '/api/v1/', // you can leave this as is
  port: '16021', // this is the standard port
  authToken: 'myAuthToken', // you can get this by taking a look at the 'Getting an Auth Token` section
});
```

#### Top-Level Functions

`controllerInfo = async (): Promise<NanoleafAttributes>` - Returns general info about the Aurora controller.
